# AI Financial Planning Agent - Proof of Concept Document

## Summary

This document outlines the development of an AI-powered financial planning agent that leverages specialized analytical tools to create comprehensive investment strategies. The system utilizes a multi-agent architecture to autonomously analyze market sentiment, current affairs, and historical data, integrating a wide array of modular tools that can be developed or integrated using the CrewAI or AutoGen framework.

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Vision
Empower individuals to make data-driven investment decisions by leveraging cutting-edge AI, modular multi-agent orchestration, and an extensible toolkit covering sentiment, news/facts, and quantitative analysis.

### 1.2 Value Proposition
- Modular, autonomous, upgradable agentic flow.
- Real-time integration of social, news, and financial data.
- Personalized and adaptable investment strategies.

## 2. System Architecture & Agentic Flow

### 2.1 Multi-Agent & Tool-Based Design
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Manages workflow, agent coordination, and output synthesis.
- **Sentiment Analysis Agent**: Analyzes social/news sentiment from external sources.
- **Current Affairs Agent**: Interprets news, economic, and geopolitical impacts.
- **Quantitative Analysis Agent**: Conducts financial modeling, technical/statistical analysis, and backtesting.

### 2.2 End-to-End Flow
1. User query or profile triggers workflow.
2. Orchestrator agent interprets and triggers appropriate tools and agents, possibly in parallel.
3. Agents use modular tools to ingest, analyze, and generate results from relevant data sources.
4. Outputs are integrated, scored, and returned in a user-friendly strategy report.

  - *RiskMetricsCalculator*: Computes portfolio risk stats (Sharpe, VaR, beta, etc.).
  - *BacktestingEngine*: Flexible engine supporting custom logic and cost modeling.
  - *CorrelationAnalyzer*: Cross-asset and rolling correlations.

### 3.4 Orchestrator & Integration Tools
- Meta-decision and synthesis utilities:
  - *MarketRegimeDetector*: Classifies bull/bear/sideways periods.
  - *SignalAggregator*: Weighted ensemble of agent outputs.
  - *RiskBudgetOptimizer*: Allocates exposure within user-defined risk limits.

### 3.5 Data Management and Utility Tools
- Data quality and reliability:
  - *PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, Redis, MongoDB*: Backends for time-series, structured, and unstructured data.
  - *DataValidator*: Cleans input data, handles gaps/outliers.
  - *DataSynchronizer*: Timestamp alignment and data frequency management.
- Alerting and reporting:
  - *AlertSystem*: Threshold-triggered investment alerts (email/SMS/webhook).
  - *ReportGenerator*: Creates user-facing reports with executive summary, charts, risk explanations.
- API/rate/utilities:
  - *APIRateLimiter*: Handles quota/hard limit rotation and error backoff.

## 4. Example Code Snippets for Custom Tools
- For each agent, new tools should inherit from a base `Tool` class with a `_run()` method. Skeletons for Sentiment, News, Technical Indicators, and Orchestrator tools are included in the detailed writeup above.

---

## 5. Implementation Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Start with Quantitative Analysis Agent (yfinance, pandas, Backtrader, TA-Lib tools)
- **Phase 2**: Add Sentiment and News/Current Affairs agents with needed APIs and NLP models.
- **Phase 3**: Expand tool library, full agentic orchestration, and robust report/alerting suite
- **Phase 4**: Production deployment with database, alerting, compliance, and monitoring tools

---

## 6. Success Criteria & Recommendations
- Modular tool/plugin ecosystem allows rapid evolution
- Flexible orchestration enables adaptation to regulatory, market, or user needs
- Comprehensive data pipeline ensures reliability and transparency

---

## 7. Open Questions/Next Steps
- Confirm coverage of all compliance, risk, user, and integration needs
- Prioritize next steps for MVP agent, toolset, and deployment
